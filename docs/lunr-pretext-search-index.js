  "body": " Review of Linear and Quadratic Functions  In MAT 103, you learned how to solve linear and quadratic equations and how to use these to model real world situations. The graph of a linear function is a line, and its equation is often written in slope-intercept form  where is the slope of the line and is the vertical intercept (the point where the line crosses the vertical axis) or point-slope form  where is the slope of the line and is any point on the line. Slope is a measure of the steepness of a line. For a linear function , the slope of a line can be calculated as the ratio     Let be as shown in the graph below.   Graph of .   The graph of is a straight line with negative slope. It intersects the vertical axis at and crosses the horizontal axis at . The function decreases steadily as increases.

The origin is at the center. Both axes have arrowheads, and the grid consists of evenly spaced squares suitable for plotting points or graphs.      Write the equation of the circle.    Find the circumference and area of the circle.      An arc of a circle is a piece of a circle, and has length. A sector is a part of the plane enclosed by two radii and an arc of a circle, and has area. One radian is the measure of an angle that subtends an arc of length 1 on the unit circle.   In , the unit circle is shown. In the figure, is the arc and the shaded region is a sector. radian, because the arc , the distance along the circle from point to point , has length 1.   Sector of a unit circle illustrating an arc   A unit circle centered at the origin with a shaded sector between points and on the circumference. The sector is bounded by radii from the origin to and , and the arc labeled . The radius is 1 unit, and the circle is drawn on a coordinate grid with axes labeled from -1 to 1. Points are marked: near the first quadrant, at the origin, and on the positive x-axis. The arc and sector highlight a portion of the circle.    It is sometimes handy to be able to convert degree measure to radian measure. Since the circumference of the unit circle is , this means that the radian measure of an angle corresponding to a complete circle is also radians. Suppose that an angle measures (Greek letter alpha) in degrees, but radians. We can set up a proportion . If we solve for , we have the degrees-to-radians conversion formula .   Convert the angles , , , and to radians.    Convert the angles radians, radians and radians to degrees.    Working with arc length.    What is the length of the arc along a circle of radius 7 cut out by an angle of ?    What is the length of the arc along a circle of radius 3 cut out by an angle of radians?

What is the area of the sector cut out of a circle of radius 5 by an angle of radians?      You are at a picnic when you notice an ant crawling along the edge of your 9-inch circular apple pie. The ant enters the rim of the pie plate at the 3 o’clock position and walks at a constant rate around the rim of the pie plate to the 11 o’clock position, where he exits the pie plate.    Draw a diagram of the ant’s path.    How far did the ant walk on the rim of the pie plate?    If the ant walks 1.5 inches per second, how long did it take it to walk from the 3 o’clock position to the 11 o’clock position on the pie plate.    If your pie is cut into 8 equal pieces, find the area of the top one piece.    Your brother has an 8-inch circular chocolate pie that is cut in 7 pieces. He wants to trade you one piece of apple pie for one piece of chocolate pie. Is this a fair trade?    How far would the ant have walked if he walked in a straight line across the pie instead of along the rim?     "

  "body": " Modeling with Trigonometric Functions  Goals:    T: Be able to model a situation involving motion on a circle with appropriate trigonometric parametric equation(s) and interpret the solution.    Early in the semester, we saw that parametric equations can be used to describe the motion of an object in the plane. More recently, we have seen that the sine and cosine functions can be used to describe the coordinates of a point on the unit circle. In this section, we bring these two ideas together to develop parametric equations that describe the position of an object as it moves in a circle.   A Ferris wheel with a radius of 5 meters is mounted so that the center is 6 meters above the ground. At time , a rider is in the 3 o’clock position on the wheel. The wheel makes one complete counterclockwise turn in 30 seconds.    Draw a diagram showing the Ferris wheel, with the origin at ground level under the center of the wheel.    Write parametric equations to describe the position of the rider at time .    How far does the rider travel in the first 5 seconds of the ride?    What are the coordinates of the rider at seconds?    Find two times when the rider is 10 meters above ground level.      The solution to is shown below.     Parametric Motion on a Circle   A coordinate plane showing a circle of radius 5 centered at (0,6). The rightmost point (5,6) is labeled t=0, the top point (0,11) is labeled t=2.5, the left point (−5,6) is labeled t=15, and the bottom point (0,1) is labeled t=22.5. A radius from (0,6) to (5,6) is drawn and labeled 5.     First write an equation for . Start by making a table of the -values at each labeled time. Then graph the values in the table.   Table and Graph of                                  A graph of x as a function of t showing a smooth periodic curve. The graph passes through the points (0,5), (7.5,0), (15,−5), (22.5,0), and (30,5), forming one full cycle with a maximum at t=0 and t=30 and a minimum at t=15.     Using the graph, we can see that the amplitude is 5 and the midline is 0. The period is 30, so . Since the cosine function has its maximum on the y-axis, we won't need a horizontal shift if we use cosine. So our equation is  Similarly, we can find the equation of .  Table and Graph of                                  A graph of y as a function of t showing a smooth periodic curve with midline y = 6.

From the graph, we can see that the amplitude is 5, the midline is at the period is 30, so . The sine function has its midline on the -axis, so we won't need a horizontal shift if we use sine. So our equation is   In 5 seconds, the rider travels of the circle. The angle subtended by this motion is of radians, which is radians. Using the arc length formula, the distance traveled by the rider is meters.     Graph and . The rider will be at a height of 10 meters at 4.428 seconds and 10.572 seconds after the ride began.

A carousel (merry-go-round) is on a pier that juts out eastward from a straight shoreline that runs north-south. The carousel has a diameter of 30 feet and takes 18 seconds to complete one counterclockwise revolution. The center of the carousel is 60 feet from the shoreline. Eden is riding one of the carousel horses, and starts at the point farthest from the shoreline. Let denote this starting point.

The average price of a home in Cincinnati, OH, in 2015 was $111,200, and growing at about 3% per year.    If the current growth trend continues, write an exponential model for the average price of a home in Cincinnati years after 2015.    How long will it take for the average price to reach $130,000?      Let and .    Use algebra to solve .    Use Desmos to check your answer. Sketch the graph with important points labeled.    Use algebra to solve .      A carousel (merry-go-round) is on a pier that juts out westward from a straight shoreline that runs north-south. The carousel has a radius of 20 feet and takes 25 seconds to complete one counterclockwise revolution. The center of the carousel is 40 feet from the shoreline. Jenny is riding one of the carousel horses, and starts at the point farthest from the shoreline. Let denote this starting point.    Draw a diagram with the point where the pier meets the shore as the origin, and the negative -axis stretching along the pier through the center of the carousel.    Graph the distance from Jenny to the shoreline as a function of time for the interval from to seconds.    Find a function of the form that represents Jenny’s -coordinate as a function of time.    Write parametric equations describing Jenny’s location at time .    How far does Jenny travel in the first 10 seconds of her ride?    What are Jenny’s coordinates at seconds?    Find two times when Jenny is 35 feet from the shoreline.      "
